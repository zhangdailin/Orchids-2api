// handler, so they used to answer a pool failure with 503 and — in several
// handlers — the pool's error text. A cooling pool, a rate-limited pool and a
// spent allowance are all retryable capacity conditions and are answered 429 by
// the shared classification, the same answer every other entrance gives; a model
// the pool cannot route is a 404. Only the residual cases (a refused credential,
// an empty token, no accounts at all) stay 503, and they lose their internal
// detail: the operator reads it in the log.
