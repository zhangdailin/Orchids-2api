// spent allowance are all retryable capacity conditions and are answered 429 by
// the shared classification, the same answer every other entrance gives; a model
// the pool cannot route is a 404. Only the residual cases (a refused credential,
// an empty token, no accounts at all) stay 503, and they lose their internal
// detail: the operator reads it in the log.
