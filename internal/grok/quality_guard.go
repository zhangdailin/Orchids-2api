// Quality guard.
//
// Ported from chenyme/grok2api (application/gateway/quality_retry.go). A
// degraded upstream answers 200 with a response that looks fine but carries no
// reasoning: the visible text arrives as one late dump, or the reasoning is a
// cipher-only stub with zero reasoning tokens while the answer streams out.
// Those responses are indistinguishable from a healthy one by status alone, so
// the account keeps serving them and every caller keeps receiving them.
//
// This gateway streams directly to the client and therefore cannot retract a
// dump that has already been written. What it can do — and what this file does
// — is stop the credential from producing more of them: the first degraded turn
// parks the credential for a cooldown, a second one disables it. A non-streaming
// turn, which is buffered anyway, is withheld and retried on another account.
